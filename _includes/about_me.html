           I'm a curious person. I'm always asking questions and trying to understand
           how things work and how they are made. My curiosity led me to create and sell
           a web hosting company when I was 16 years old. As a computer engineer I
           keep entrepreneurship and innovation as part of my routine.

            I have over 4 years of experience as a software engineer and have worked
            at large organizations on different projects. I'm a proficient backend software engineer that
            looks for roles where seeing the big picture is a necessary thing, where I can take on on collaborative
            team leadership responsibilites.
